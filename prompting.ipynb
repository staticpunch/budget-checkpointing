      "\n",
      "=== THOUGHT ===\n",
      "Okay, so I need to find \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\) given that \\( f(a) = f(b) = f(c) \\) for the function \\( f(x) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 4 \\), where \\( a < b < c \\). Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I know that if three different points \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) have the same function value, that means they are either all roots of the equation \\( f(x) = k \\) for some constant \\( k \\), or maybe they are points where the function has the same y-value but aren't necessarily roots. Wait, the problem just says \\( f(a) = f(b) = f(c) \\), so it's possible that they all map to the same output, which could be any value, not necessarily zero. So, maybe we need to consider the equation \\( f(x) = k \\) and find the three solutions \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\), then compute the sum of their squares.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how do I find \\( k \\) such that the equation \\( x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 4 = k \\) has three distinct real roots? That would require the cubic equation \\( x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + (4 - k) = 0 \\) to have three real roots. For a cubic to have three real roots, its derivative must have two real critical points, and the function must have a local maximum and minimum where the function values cross the x-axis (or in this case, the line \\( y = k \\)) three times.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, maybe I should start by finding the critical points of \\( f(x) \\). The derivative \\( f'(x) \\) is \\( 3x^2 - 4x - 3 \\). Let's compute that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\( f'(x) = 3x^2 - 4x - 3 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "To find critical points, set \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n",
      "\n",
      "\\( 3x^2 - 4x - 3 = 0 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Solving this quadratic equation:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\( x = [4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 36}]/6 = [4 \\pm \\sqrt{52}]/6 = [4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{13}]/6 = [2 \\pm \\sqrt{13}]/3 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "So the critical points are at \\( x = (2 + \\sqrt{13})/3 \\) and \\( x = (2 - \\sqrt{13})/3 \\). Let me approximate these values to get a sense:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\( \\sqrt{13} \\) is approximately 3.6055, so:\n",
      "\n",
      "First critical point: \\( (2 + 3.6055)/3 ≈ 5.6055/3 ≈ 1.8685 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Second critical point: \\( (2 - 3.6055)/3 ≈ (-1.6055)/3 ≈ -0.5352 \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the function has a local maximum at \\( x ≈ -0.5352 \\) and a local minimum at \\( x ≈ 1.8685 \\). The function's behavior is decreasing from \\( -\\infty \\) to the local maximum, then decreasing to the local minimum, then increasing to \\( +\\infty \\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the equation \\( f(x) = k \\) will have three real roots when \\( k \\) is between the local maximum and the local minimum values. So, if \\( k \\) is equal to the local maximum or the local minimum, the equation will have a repeated root. But since the problem states \\( a < b < c \\), three distinct roots, so \\( k \\) must be strictly between the local maximum and local minimum.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to find \\( k \\), we need to compute the function values at the critical points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me compute \\( f \\) at \\( x = (2 - \\sqrt{13})/3 \\) (the left critical point, local maximum) and at \\( x = (2 + \\sqrt{13})/3 \\) (the right critical point, local minimum).\n",

      "First, let's compute \\( f((2 - \\sqrt{13})/3) \\).\n",

      "This will be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way. Since \\( x_1 \\) is a critical point, we can use the fact that the derivative is zero there. Alternatively, maybe use substitution.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe there is an error in assuming that \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\) are roots of the equation \\( x^3 -2x^2 -3x + (4 -k) =0 \\). But since \\( f(x) =k \\) implies \\( x^3 -2x^2 -3x +4 =k \\), which rearranges to \\( x^3 -2x^2 -3x + (4 -k) =0 \\), so yes, the roots are \\( a \\), \\( b \\), \\( c \\).

      "\n",
      "Hence, the answer is 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the problem states that \\( a < b < c \\). Does ordering affect the sum of squares? No, because addition is commutative. Therefore, regardless of the order, the sum remains the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the final answer is 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just to make sure, let me consider a specific case. Suppose we take \\( k =4 \\). Then, the equation becomes \\( x^3 -2x^2 -3x +0 =0 \\), so \\( x(x^2 -2x -3) =0 \\). The roots are 0, (2 ±sqrt(4 +12))/2 = (2 ±sqrt(16))/2 = (2 ±4)/2 = 3 or -1. Therefore, roots are -1, 0, 3. Then, sum of squares is (-1)^2 +0^2 +3^2 =1 +0 +9=10. Correct. So in this case, k=4, which is actually not between the local max and min. Wait, but if k=4, which is f(0)=4. But according to earlier calculations, the local maximum is (38 +26sqrt(13))/27. Let's compute that:\n",
      "\n",
      "sqrt(13)≈3.6055, so 26*3.6055≈93.743, so 38 +93.743≈131.743, divided by27≈4.879. Similarly, local minimum is (38 -26sqrt(13))/27≈(38 -93.743)/27≈(-55.743)/27≈-2.064.\n",
      "\n",
      "So k=4 is above the local maximum ≈4.879? Wait, 4.879 is greater than 4, so k=4 is below the local maximum. Therefore, the equation f(x)=4 would cross the curve three times? Wait, but in reality, when k=4, we found roots at -1,0,3. But according to the critical points, the local maximum is at x≈-0.535 with value≈(38 +26*3.6055)/27≈(38 +93.743)/27≈131.743/27≈4.879. So the local maximum is approximately 4.879. Therefore, k=4 is less than the local maximum, so the horizontal line y=4 intersects the graph three times: once to the left of the local maximum, once between the local maximum and minimum, and once to the right of the local minimum. But in our example, when k=4, we have roots at -1,0,3, which seems conflicting with the local extrema positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the local maximum is at x≈-0.535, so between -1 and 0. Then the function increases to infinity as x approaches negative infinity, decreases to the local maximum at x≈-0.535, then decreases to the local minimum at x≈1.8685, then increases to infinity. Therefore, when k=4, which is less than the local maximum (≈4.879), the horizontal line y=4 will intersect the graph three times: once left of x≈-0.535, once between x≈-0.535 and x≈1.8685, and once right of x≈1.8685. However, in the example, the roots are at x=-1, 0, 3. So x=-1 is left of the local maximum, x=0 is between local max and min, and x=3 is right of local min. So that makes sense. And indeed, their sum is -1 +0 +3=2, sum of products is (-1)(0)+(0)(3)+(-1)(3)=0 +0 -3=-3, sum of squares is 1 +0 +9=10. So that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: take k=0. Then the equation is x^3 -2x^2 -3x +4=0. Let's see if that has three real roots. Plugging in x=1: 1 -2 -3 +4=0. So x=1 is a root. Then factor it as (x-1)(x^2 -x -4)=0. Roots are 1, (1 ±sqrt(1 +16))/2=(1 ±sqrt(17))/2≈(1 ±4.123)/2≈2.561 or -1.561. So roots are approximately -1.561,1,2.561. Then sum is -1.561 +1 +2.561≈2, sum of products: (-1.561)(1) + (1)(2.561) + (-1.561)(2.561)≈-1.561 +2.561 -3.999≈-3, sum of squares≈(-1.561)^2 +1^2 +2.561^2≈2.437 +1 +6.559≈10. So again, sum of squares is 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, regardless of k (as long as the equation has three real roots), the sum of squares is 10. Therefore, the answer is 10.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the problem says \"if f(a)=f(b)=f(c)\", so the same value for all three. So this k is the same for all three, so the roots of the equation f(x)=k. Therefore, Vieta's applies, and the sum is 10.\n",

    "Use a set opened_doors to track which doors (1, 2, 3) are opened. Initialize empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a mapping (e.g., a list or dictionary) to store which key is behind which door. door_keys = [a, b, c], where door_keys[0] is key behind door 1, door_keys[1] behind door 2, door_keys[2] behind door 3.\n",

    "After the loop terminates, check if len(opened_doors) == 3. If yes, output YES, otherwise NO.\n",
